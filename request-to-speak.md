Call for Speakers
=================

The Seattle Node.js Meetup typically hosts a meetup once a month with two 20-30
minute talks. We occasionally throw lightning talks into the mix.

We'd love to have you share your Node.js knowledge with our group!

Speaking at a meetup is a great opportunity to share with the community, meet
new folks interested in stuff you're interested in, and enhance your public
speaking chops in a very friendly, supportive environment.

( _Note: We've forked this request to speak template from the
[SeattleJS Meetup](https://github.com/seattlejs/seattlejs/blob/master/request-to-speak.md).
They're also a great meetup at which to speak and share JavaScript-y goodness._ )


## How it works

* Read the guidelines below.
* Submit a proposal via a
  [GitHub issue](https://github.com/seanode/meetup/issues/new) or email
  `seattlenode@gmail.com`. Please follow the [template](#talk-proposal-template).
    * _Public GitHub issues are just for our organizational convenience. We're
      equally thrilled getting private emails of talk proposals!_
* If the proposal sounds like something that will work for our members, we'll
  group the talk with similar proposals and schedule it.


## What makes a good talk?

The Seattle Node.js meetup has over 2,000 members, with events typically ranging
in size from 50-150 attendees.

Our meetup has folks with experiences ranging from "just trying out Node.js" to
folks hacking deep within the internals of V8 in their Node.js engines. And
we've had talks cover that entire spectrum too.


## Topics

We're generally interested in anything moving the dial forward on Node.js,
solving common problems, and using Node.js to write great applications.

Here are just a couple of random suggestions:

* Node.js on hardware (radios, IoT, etc.)

* Node.js in music / media.

* Application monitoring / tooling.

* Performance / profiling.

* Debugging / internals deep dives.

* Development / task workflows.

* Game development on Node.js.

* Node.js at scale / in production.

* ESnext / language evolution in Node.js

* Node.js testing, quality tools.

* npm usage, analysis, workflows.

* Sharing backend Node.js code with the browser.
