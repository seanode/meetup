Seattle Node.js Meetup
======================

Welcome to Seattle Node.js! We are a group of Node.js enthusiasts and
technologists interested in event-based programming, highly-concurrent
applications, and bringing JavaScript to the server-side. We hope that you join
us and help the Node.js community continue to grow in Seattle.

Our official [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Node-js/) page provides
event descriptions and reservations. We also hang out at:
